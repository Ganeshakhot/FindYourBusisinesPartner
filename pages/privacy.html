            Find Your Business Partner follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and are a part of hosting services’ analytics. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any personally identifiable information. The purpose of the information is to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement on the website, and gather demographic information.
            
            How Long We Retain Your Data?
            When users submit their data during registration or content creation, their data remains safe with us until they delete it.
            All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information. However, you cannot delete the questions created by you.
